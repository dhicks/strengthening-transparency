  abstract: >-
    The underdetermination argument establishes that scientists may use
    political values to guide inquiry, without providing criteria for
    distinguishing legitimate from illegitimate guidance. This paper supplies
    such criteria. Analysis of the confused arguments against value-laden
    science reveals the fundamental criterion of illegitimate guidance: when
    value judgments operate to drive inquiry to a predetermined conclusion. A
    case study of feminist research on divorce reveals numerous legitimate ways
    that values can guide science without violating this standard.

    This paper evaluates the ability of various research designs in measuring
    small effects, that of air pollution on health in the short-term. Analyzing
    the epidemiology and economics literature, we ﬁrst show that a portion of
    these estimates are likely inaccurate. In the presence of publication bias,
    relatively small eﬀects are not only diﬃcult to detect, but resulting
    estimates also exaggerate true eﬀect sizes. We identify the design
    parameters causing this issue using real data simulations replicating most
    prevailing methods. Finally, we propose a principled workﬂow to evaluate and
    avoid the risk of exaggeration when conducting an observational study.

    It's natural to think of scientists as truth seekers, people driven by an
    intense curiosity to understand the natural world. Yet this picture of
    scientists and scientific inquiry sits uncomfortably with the reality and
    prevalence of scientific fraud. If one wants to get at the truth about
    nature, why lie? Won't that just set inquiry back, as people pursue false
    leads? To understand why this occurs – and what can be done about it – we
    need to understand the social structures scientists work within, and how
    some of the institutions which enable science to be such a successful
    endeavour all things considered, also abet and encourage fraud.

  abstract: >-
    The idea that science is or should be value-free, and that values are or
    should be formed independently of science, has been under fire by
    philosophers of science for decades. Science and Moral Imagination directly
    challenges the idea that science and values cannot and should not influence
    each other. Matthew J. Brown argues that science and values mutually
    influence and implicate one another, that the influence of values on science
    is pervasive and must be responsibly managed, and that science can and
    should have an influence on our values. This interplay, he explains, must be
    guided by accounts of scientific inquiry and value judgment that are
    sensitive to the complexities of their interactions. Brown presents
    scientific inquiry and value judgment as types of problem-solving practices
    and provides a new framework for thinking about how we might ethically
    evaluate episodes and decisions in science, while offering guidance for
    scientific practitioners and institutions about how they can incorporate
    value judgments into their work. His framework, dubbed "the ideal of moral
    imagination," emphasizes the role of imagination in value judgment and the
    positive role that value judgment plays in science.

  abstract: >-
    I have argued that political values are beliefs informed, more or less well,
    by the evidence of experience and that, where relevant and well-supported by
    evidence, the inclusion of political values in scientific theorizing can
    increase the objectivity of research (e.g., Clough 2003, 2004, 2011). The
    position I endorse has been called the “values-as-evidence” approach
    (Goldenberg 2013). In this essay I respond to three kinds of resistance to
    this approach, using examples of feminist political values. Solomon (2012)
    questions whether values are beliefs that can be tested, Alcoff (2006)
    argues that even if our values are beliefs that can be tested, testing them
    might not be desirable because doing so assigns these important values a
    contingency that weakens their normative force, and Yap (2016) argues that
    the approach is too idealistic in its articulation of the role of evidence
    in our political deliberations. In response, I discuss the ways that values
    can be tested, I analyze the evidential strength of feminist values in
    science, and I argue that the evidence-based nature of these values is
    neither a weakness nor an idealization. Problems with political values
    affecting science properly concern the dogmatic ways that evaluative beliefs
    are sometimes held—a problem that arises with dogmatism toward descriptive
    beliefs as well. I conclude that scientists, as with the rest of us, ought
    to adopt a pragmatically-inclined appreciation of the fallible, inductive
    process by which we gather evidence in support of any of our beliefs,
    whether they are described as evaluative or descriptive.

    Millions of scientific articles are published each year, making it difficult
    to stay abreast of advances within even the smallest subdisciplines.
    Traditional approaches to the study of science, such as the history and
    philosophy of science, involve closely reading a relatively small set of
    journal articles. And yet many questions benefit from casting a wider net:
    Is most scientific change gradual or revolutionary? What are the key sources
    of scientific novelty? Over the past several decades, a massive effort to
    digitize the academic literature and equip computers with algorithms that
    can distantly read and analyze a digital database has taken us one step
    closer to answering these questions. The Dynamics of Science brings together
    a diverse array of contributors to examine the largely unexplored
    computational frontiers of history and philosophy of science. Together, they
    reveal how tools and data from automated textual analysis, or machine
    “reading,” combined with methods and models from game theory and cultural
    evolutionary theory, can begin to answer fundamental questions about the
    nature and history of science.

    A recent study reported associations between infant mortality and

    or other covariates. Recent daily time-series studies, which are likely to

  abstract: >-
    Protecting science from politicization is an ongoing concern in contemporary
    society. Yet some political influences on science (e.g., setting public
    funding amounts) are fully legitimate. We need to have a clear account of
    when a political influence is politicization (an illegitimate political
    influence) in order to properly detect and address the problem. I argue in
    this paper that understanding how the space of scientific inquiry is
    distinctive from democratic politics can be the basis for defining
    politicization. Similarities between inquiry and democratic politics have
    long been noted, but there are important differences as well. I describe
    four norms that are importantly distinct for inquiry when compared with
    democratic politics, even if they can be seen as roughly similar. Although
    there are parallels between democratic political norms and norms for
    scientific inquiry, there are crucial differences as well. Eliding these
    differences creates politicization of inquiry. Even as we understand
    scientific inquiry as pursued within society and responsible to society, we
    pursue it in a distinctive space, guided by distinctive norms and practices.

    Although epistemic values have become widely accepted as part of scientific
    reasoning, non-epistemic values have been largely relegated to the
    "external" parts of science (the selection of hypotheses, restrictions on
    methodologies, and the use of scientific technologies). I argue that because
    of inductive risk, or the risk of error, non-epistemic values are required
    in science wherever non-epistemic consequences of error should be
    considered. I use examples from dioxin studies to illustrate how
    non-epistemic consequences of error can and should be considered in the
    internal stages of science: choice of methodology, characterization of data,
    and interpretation of results.

  abstract: >-
    The role of values in scientific research has become an important topic of
    discussion in both scholarly and popular debates. Pundits across the
    political spectrum worry that research on topics like climate change,
    evolutionary theory, vaccine safety, and genetically modified foods has
    become overly politicized. At the same time, it is clear that values play an
    important role in science by limiting unethical forms of research and by
    deciding what areas of research have the greatest relevance for society.
    Deciding how to distinguish legitimate and illegitimate influences of values
    in scientific research is a matter of vital importance. Recently,
    philosophers of science have written a great deal on this topic, but most of
    their work has been directed toward a scholarly audience. This book makes
    the contemporary philosophical literature on science and values accessible
    to a wide readership. It examines case studies from a variety of research
    areas, including climate science, anthropology, chemical risk assessment,
    ecology, neurobiology, biomedical research, and agriculture. These cases
    show that values have necessary roles to play in identifying research
    topics, choosing research questions, determining the aims of inquiry,
    responding to uncertainty, and deciding how to communicate information.
    Kevin Elliott focuses not just on describing roles for values but also on
    determining when their influences are actually appropriate. He emphasizes
    several conditions for incorporating values in a legitimate fashion, and
    highlights multiple strategies for fostering engagement between stakeholders
    so that value influences can be subjected to careful and critical scrutiny.

  abstract: >-
    More than a decade of exacting scientific research involving paleontological
    fragments and ancient DNA has lately produced a series of pronouncements
    about a purportedly novel population of archaic hominins dubbed “the
    Denisova.” The science involved in these matters is both technically
    stunning and, socially, at times a bit reckless. Here I discuss the
    responsibilities which scientists incur when they make inductively risky
    pronouncements about the different relative contributions by Denisovans to
    genomes of members of apparent subpopulations of current humans (i.e., the
    so-called “races”). This science is sensational: it is science which
    empirically speculates, to the public delight’s and entertainment, about
    scintillating topics such as when humans evolved, where we came from, and
    who else we were having sex with during our early hominin history. An
    initial characterization of sensational science emerges from my discussion
    of the case, as well as a diagnosis of an interactive phenomenon termed
    amplified inductive risk.

    Scholars in the history, philosophy, and social studies of science often
    explain public scientific controversies by appealing to views of the general
    public on appropriate roles for values in science. However, evidence that
    members of the public actually hold these views is limited. This paper
    presents the Values in Science Scale (VISS), a quantitative survey
    instrument designed to measure these views. Qualitative methods were used to
    ensure construct validity among US adults (Study 2). In one notable initial
    finding using VISS, the value-free ideal (VFI) — a traditional conception of
    objectivity — is not correlated with generalized trust in science.

  abstract: >-
    Concerns about a crisis of mass irreplicability across scientific fields
    (“the replication crisis”) have stimulated a movement for open science,
    encouraging or even requiring researchers to publish their raw data and
    analysis code. Recently, a rule at the US Environmental Protection Agency
    (US EPA) would have imposed a strong open data requirement. The rule
    prompted significant public discussion about whether open science practices
    are appropriate for fields of environmental public health. The aims of this
    paper are to assess (1) whether the replication crisis extends to fields of
    environmental public health; and (2) in general whether open science
    requirements can address the replication crisis. There is little empirical
    evidence for or against mass irreplicability in environmental public health
    specifically. Without such evidence, strong claims about whether the
    replication crisis extends to environmental public health — or not — seem
    premature. By distinguishing three concepts — reproducibility,
    replicability, and robustness — it is clear that open data initiatives can
    promote reproducibility and robustness but do little to promote
    replicability. I conclude by reviewing some of the other benefits of open
    science, and offer some suggestions for funding streams to mitigate the
    costs of adoption of open science practices in environmental public health.

    Anthropologists and human geneticists have long rejected race science,
    research that can be utilized to purportedly justify racial inequality and
    colonialism.  But race science has persisted, at the very least on the
    margins of the mainstream scientific community.  In this study,
    scientometric and text mining methods were used to trace the appearance of
    race science discourse in both mainstream behavioral science journals and
    the parascholarly journal *Mankind Quarterly* from 1960 to 2010.  Our
    analysis found two distinguishable lines of race science discourse.  One is
    strongly associated with *Mankind Quarterly*, while the other — emphasizing
    race and intelligence — is more prevalent with mainstream psychology
    journals, especially *Intelligence* and *Personality and Individual
    Differences*.  We compare psychology's response to race science to those of
    other fields, and discuss the social responsibility of scientists with
    respect to race science.

  abstract: >-
    While philosophers of science generally agree that social, political, and
    ethical values can play legitimate roles in science, there is active debate
    over whether scientists should disclosure such values in their public
    communications. This debate depends, in part, on empirical claims about
    whether values disclosures might undermine public trust in science. In a
    previous study, Elliott et al. used an online experiment to test this
    empirical claim. The current paper reports a replication attempt of their
    experiment. Comparing results of the original study and our replication, we
    do not find evidence for a transparency penalty or “shared values” effect,
    but do find evidence that the content of scientific conclusions (whether or
    not a chemical is found to cause harm) might effect perceived
    trustworthiness and that scientists who value public health and disclose
    this value might be perceived as more trustworthy.

  abstract: >-
    <p>Since at least the mid-2000s, political commentators, environmental
    advocates, and scientists have raised concerns about an “anti-science”
    approach to environmental policymaking in conservative governments in the US
    and Canada. This paper explores and resolves a paradox surrounding at least
    some uses of the “anti-science” epithet. I examine two cases of such
    “anti-science” environmental policy, both of which involve appeals to
    epistemic values that are widely endorsed by both scientists and
    philosophers of science. It seems paradoxical to call an appeal to epistemic
    values “anti-science.” I develop an analysis that, I argue, can resolve this
    paradox. This analysis is a version of the “aims approach” to science and
    values, drawing on ideas from axiology and virtue ethics. I characterize the
    paradox in terms of conflicts or tensions between epistemic and pragmatic
    aims, and argue that there is a key asymmetry between them: epistemic aims
    are valuable, in part, because they are useful for pursuing pragmatic aims.
    Thus, when epistemic and pragmatic aims conflict, epistemic aims need to be
    reconceptualized in order to reconcile them to pragmatic aims. When this is
    done, in the “anti-science” cases, the epistemic values are scientific vices
    rather than virtues. Thus the “anti-science” epithet is apt.</p>

  abstract: >-
    While it is widely acknowledged that science is not “free” of non-epistemic
    values, there is disagreement about the roles that values can appropriately
    play. Several have argued that non-epistemic values can play important roles
    in modeling decisions, particularly in addressing uncertainties (Moss and
    Schneider 2000; Kandlikar et al. (C.R. Geoscience 337:443-455, 2005); Risbey
    2007; Biddle and Winsberg 2010; Winsberg (Kennedy Institute of Ethics
    Journal 22(2): 111-137, 2012); van der Sluijs (Climatic Change 75 (3)
    359-389, 2012). On the other hand, such values can (even unconsciously) lead
    to bias (Pielke 2007; Oppenhiemer et al. (Science 317:1505-1506, 2007); Bray
    (Environmental Science & Policy 13:340-350, 2010); Oreskes and Conway 2010).
    Thus, it is important to identify when it is legitimate to appeal to
    non-epistemic values in modeling decisions. An approach is defended here
    whereby such value judgments are legitimate when they promote democratically
    endorsed epistemological and social aims of research. This framework
    accounts for why it is legitimate to appeal to non-epistemic values in a
    range of modeling decisions, while addressing concerns that the presence of
    such values will lead to bias or give scientists disproportionate power in
    deciding what values ought to be endorsed.

    Philosophers commonly make claims about the aims of science, and these
    claims have played a significant role in debates about topics like
    scientific realism, modeling, and idealization. Nevertheless, there has been
    little discussion about the basis for those aims or the source of
    justification for claims about those aims. We use recent debates about the
    appropriate roles for values in science to bring this lack of discussion to
    the fore. These debates raise the question of whether there are global aims
    that apply to all areas of science. In response to this question, we examine
    a variety of different ways of conceptualizing the aims of science and
    conclude that no matter how one conceptualizes them, there do not appear to
    be convincing arguments for the view that science has global aims that
    constrain the influence of local aims on scientific practice. Thus, we place
    the burden of proof on those who claim that science has one or more global
    aims of this sort to show how those aims can be justified. Furthermore, we
    develop an account of scientific normativity that relies solely on local
    aims. When applied to debates about values in science, this view vindicates
    the cogency of what we call an “equal aims” approach to managing roles for
    values in science. Abandoning global aims might seem to raise the potential
    for epistemic corruption in science, but we argue that this concern is not
    compelling. We conclude that a local conception of scientific aims provides
    the foundation for a highly naturalized and engaged approach to the
    philosophy of science.

    Topic model is a well proven tool to investigate the semantic content of
    textual corpora. Yet corpora sometimes include texts in several languages,
    making it impossible to apply language-specific computational approaches
    over their entire content. This is the problem we encountered when setting
    to analyze a philosophy of science corpus spanning over eight decades and
    including original articles in Dutch, German and French, on top of a large
    majority of articles in English. To circumvent this multilingual problem, we
    use machine-translation tools to bulk translate non-English documents into
    English. Though largely imperfect, especially syntactically, these
    translations nevertheless provide correctly translated terms and preserve
    the semantic proximity of documents with respect to one another. To assess
    the quality of this translation step, we develop a “semantic topology
    preservation test” that relies on estimating the extent to which
    document-to-document distances have been preserved during translation. We
    then conduct an LDA topic-model analysis over the entire corpus of
    translated and English original texts, and compare it to a topic-model done
    over the English original texts only. We thereby identify the specific
    contribution of the translated texts. These studies reveal a more complete
    picture of main topics that can found in the philosophy of science
    literature, especially during the early days of the discipline when numerous
    articles were published in languages other than English.

    As a discipline of its own, the philosophy of science can be traced back to
    the founding of its academic journals, some of which go back to the first
    half of the twentieth century. While the discipline has been the object of
    many historical studies, notably focusing on specific schools (e.g., logical
    empiricism) or major figures of the field (e.g., Carnap, Kuhn), little work
    has focused on the journals themselves. Here, we investigate contemporary
    philosophy of science by means of computational text-mining approaches: we
    apply topic-modeling algorithms to eight major philosophy of science
    journals, from the 1930s up until 2017. Based on the full-text content of
    some 15,897 articles, we identified 25 research themes and 8 thematic
    clusters that show how the research agenda of the philosophy of science has
    changed in its content over the course of the last eight decades, up to the
    philosophy of science we now know. We also show how each one of the journals
    contributed in its own way to this thematic evolution.

    biology has already triggered investigations about its own history (e.g.,
    Grene and Depew in The philosophy of biology: an episodic history, Cambridge
    University Press, Cambridge, 2004. https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511819018;
    Hull, in: Ruse (ed) The Oxford handbook of philosophy of biology, Oxford
    University Press, New York, pp 11–33, 2008). When it comes to assessing the
    road since travelled—the research questions that have been pursued—manuals
    and ontologies also offer specific viewpoints, highlighting dedicated
    domains of inquiry and select work. In this article, we propose to approach
    the history of the philosophy of biology with a complementary data-driven
    perspective that makes use of statistical algorithms applied to the complete
    full-text corpus of one major journal of the field—Biology and
    Philosophy—from its launch in 1986 up until 2017. By running text-mining and
    topic-modeling algorithms, we identified 67 key research topics that span
    across these 32 years. We also investigated the evolution of these topics
    over time and their fluctuating significance in the journal articles. Our
    results concur with known episodes or traits of the discipline—for instance,
    the significance of evolution-related topics or the decrease of articles
    with a marked historical dimension—but also highlight a diversity of topics
    that is much richer than what is usually acknowledged.

  abstract: >-
    Since the early 1990s, the American conservative movement has become
    increasingly hostile toward environmental protection and Congressional
    Republicans have become increasingly anti-environmental in their voting
    records. Party sorting theory holds that such political polarization among
    elites will likely extend to the general public. Analyzing General Social
    Survey data from 1974 to 2012, we examine whether political polarization has
    occurred on support for government spending on environmental protection over
    this time period in the US general public. We find that there has been
    significant partisan and ideological polarization on support for
    environmental spending since 1992—consistent with the expectations of party
    sorting theory. This political polarization on environmental concern in the
    general public will likely endure save for political convergence on
    environmental concern among elites in the near future. Such polarization
    likely will inhibit the further development and implementation of
    environmental policy and the diffusion of environmentally friendly
    behaviors.

  abstract: >-
    Search in an environment with an uncertain distribution of resources
    involves a trade-off between exploitation of past discoveries and further
    exploration. This extends to information foraging, where a knowledge-seeker
    shifts between reading in depth and studying new domains. To study this
    decision-making process, we examine the reading choices made by one of the
    most celebrated scientists of the modern era: Charles Darwin. From the
    full-text of books listed in his chronologically-organized reading journals,
    we generate topic models to quantify his local (text-to-text) and global
    (text-to-past) reading decisions using Kullback-Liebler Divergence, a
    cognitively-validated, information-theoretic measure of relative surprise.
    Rather than a pattern of surprise-minimization, corresponding to a pure
    exploitation strategy, Darwin’s behavior shifts from early exploitation to
    later exploration, seeking unusually high levels of cognitive surprise
    relative to previous eras. These shifts, detected by an unsupervised
    Bayesian model, correlate with major intellectual epochs of his career as
    identified both by qualitative scholarship and Darwin’s own self-commentary.
    Our methods allow us to compare his consumption of texts with their
    publication order. We find Darwin’s consumption more exploratory than the
    culture’s production, suggesting that underneath gradual societal changes
    are the explorations of individual synthesis and discovery. Our quantitative
    methods advance the study of cognitive search through a framework for
    testing interactions between individual and collective behavior and between
    short- and long-term consumption choices. This novel application of topic
    modeling to characterize individual reading complements widespread studies
    of collective scientific behavior.

  abstract: >-
    This article proposes a three-step methodological framework called
    computational grounded theory, which combines expert human knowledge and
    hermeneutic skills with the processing power and pattern recognition of
    computers, producing a more methodologically rigorous but interpretive
    approach to content analysis. The first, pattern detection step, involves
    inductive computational exploration of text, using techniques such as
    unsupervised machine learning and word scores to help researchers to see
    novel patterns in their data. The second, pattern refinement step, returns
    to an interpretive engagement with the data through qualitative deep reading
    or further exploration of the data. The third, pattern confirmation step,
    assesses the inductively identified patterns using further computational and
    natural language processing techniques. The result is an efficient,
    rigorous, and fully reproducible computational grounded theory. This
    framework can be applied to any qualitative text as data, including
    transcribed speeches, interviews, open-ended survey data, or ethnographic
    field notes, and can address many potential research questions.

    There is increasing attention to the centrality of idealization in science.
    One common view is that models and other idealized representations are
    important to science, but that they fall short in one or more ways. On this
    view, there must be an intermediary step between idealized representation
    and the traditional aims of science, including truth, explanation, and
    prediction. Here I develop an alternative interpretation of the relationship
    between idealized representation and the aims of science. I suggest that
    continuing, widespread idealization calls into question the idea that
    science aims for truth. If instead science aims to produce understanding,
    this would enable idealizations to directly contribute to science's
    epistemic success. I also use the fact of widespread idealization to
    motivate the idea that science's wide variety aims, epistemic and
    non-epistemic, are best served by different kinds of scientific products.
    Finally, I show how these diverse aims—most rather distant from truth—result
    in the expanded influence of social values on science.

    Science is the study of our world, as it is in its messy reality.
    Nonetheless, science requires idealization to function—if we are to attempt
    to understand the world, we have to find ways to reduce its complexity. 
    Idealization and the Aims of Science shows just how crucial idealization is
    to science and why it matters. Beginning with the acknowledgment of our
    status as limited human agents trying to make sense of an exceedingly
    complex world, Angela Potochnik moves on to explain how science aims to
    depict and make use of causal patterns—a project that makes essential use of
    idealization. She offers case studies from a number of branches of science
    to demonstrate the ubiquity of idealization, shows how causal patterns are
    used to develop scientific explanations, and describes how the necessarily
    imperfect connection between science and truth leads to researchers’ values
    influencing their findings. The resulting book is a tour de force, a
    synthesis of the study of idealization that also offers countless new
    insights and avenues for future exploration.

    OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of
    prenatal exposure to chlorpyrifos on 3-year neurodevelopment and behavior in
    a sample of inner-city minority children.

    METHODS. As part of an ongoing prospective cohort study in an inner-city
    minority population, neurotoxicant effects of prenatal exposure to
    chlorpyrifos were evaluated in 254 children through the first 3 years of
    life. This report examined cognitive and motor development at 12, 24, and 36
    months (measured with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II) and child
    behavior at 36 months (measured with the Child Behavior Checklist) as a
    function of chlorpyrifos levels in umbilical cord plasma.

    RESULTS. Highly exposed children (chlorpyrifos levels of >6.17 pg/g plasma)
    scored, on average, 6.5 points lower on the Bayley Psychomotor Development
    Index and 3.3 points lower on the Bayley Mental Development Index at 3 years
    of age compared with those with lower levels of exposure. Children exposed
    to higher, compared with lower, chlorpyrifos levels were also significantly
    more likely to experience Psychomotor Development Index and Mental
    Development Index delays, attention problems,
    attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder problems, and pervasive
    developmental disorder problems at 3 years of age.

    CONCLUSIONS. The adjusted mean 36-month Psychomotor Development Index and
    Mental Development Index scores of the highly and lower exposed groups
    differed by only 7.1 and 3.0 points, respectively, but the proportion of
    delayed children in the high-exposure group, compared with the low-exposure
    group, was 5 times greater for the Psychomotor Development Index and 2.4
    times greater for the Mental Development Index, increasing the number of
    children possibly needing early intervention services.

    The debate about the rational and the social in science has sometimes been
    developed in the context of a distinction between epistemic and
    non-epistemic values. Paying particular attention to two important
    discussion in the last decade, by Longino and by McMullin, I argue that a
    fuller understanding of values in science ultimately requires abandoning the
    distinction itself. This is argued directly in terms of an analysis of the
    lack of clarity concerning what epistemic values are. I also argue that the
    philosophical import of much of the feminist work in philosophy of science
    is restricted by any kind of strict adherence to the distinction.

    Anglophone philosophers of mind generally use the term“belief” to refer to
    the attitude we have, roughly,whenever we take something to be the case or
    regard it as true. Tobelieve something, in this sense, needn’t involve
    activelyreflecting on it: Of the vast number of things ordinary
    adultsbelieve, only a few can be at the fore of the mind at any single
    time.Nor does the term “belief”, in standard philosophicalusage, imply any
    uncertainty or any extended reflection about thematter in question (as it
    sometimes does in ordinary English usage).Many of the things we believe, in
    the relevant sense, are quitemundane: that we have heads, that it’s the 21st
    century, that acoffee mug is on the desk. Forming beliefs is thus one of the
    mostbasic and important features of the mind, and the concept of beliefplays
    a crucial role in both philosophy of mind and epistemology. The“mind-body
    problem”, for example, so central to philosophyof mind, is in part the
    question of whether and how a purely physicalorganism can have beliefs. Much
    of epistemology revolves aroundquestions about when and how our beliefs are
    justified or qualify asknowledge.

    Critics of the ideal of value‐free science often assume that they must
    reject the distinction between epistemic and nonepistemic values. I argue
    that this assumption is mistaken and that the distinction can be used to
    clarify and defend the argument from inductive risk, which challenges the
    value‐free ideal. I develop the idea that the characteristic feature of
    epistemic values is that they promote, either intrinsically or
    extrinsically, the attainment of truths. This proposal is shown to answer
    common objections to the distinction and provide a principled basis for
    separating legitimate from illegitimate influences of nonepistemic values in
    scientific inference.

    Learn how to conduct a robust text analysis project from start to
    finish--and then do it again. Mining is the dominant metaphor in
    computational text analysis. When mining texts, the implied assumption is
    that analysts can find kernels of truth--they just have to sift through the
    rubbish first. In this book, Dustin Stoltz and Marshall Taylor encourage
    text analysts to work with a different metaphor in mind: mapping. When
    mapping texts, the goal is not necessarily to find meaningful needles in the
    haystack, but instead to create reductions of the text to document patterns.
    Just like with cartographic maps, though, the type and nature of the textual
    map is dependent on a range of decisions on the part of the researcher.
    Creating reproducible workflows is therefore critical for the text
    analyst.Mapping Texts offers a practical introduction to computational text
    analysis with step-by-step guides on how to conduct actual text analysis
    workflows in the R statistical computing environment. The focus is on social
    science questions and applications, with data ranging from fake news and
    presidential campaigns to Star Trek and pop stars. The book walks the reader
    through all facets of a text analysis workflow--from understanding the
    theories of language embedded in text analysis, all the way to more advanced
    and cutting-edge techniques.The book will prove useful not only to social
    scientists, but anyone interested in conducting text analysis projects.

                 Learn how to conduct a robust text analysis project from start to finish--and then do it again. Mining is the dominant metaphor in computational text analysis. When mining texts, the implied assumption is that analysts can find kernels of truth--they just have to sift through the rubbish first. In this book, Dustin Stoltz and Marshall Taylor encourage text analysts to work with a different metaphor in mind: mapping. When mapping texts, the goal is not necessarily to find meaningful needles in the haystack, but instead to create reductions of the text to document patterns. Just like with cartographic maps, though, the type and nature of the textual map is dependent on a range of decisions on the part of the researcher. Creating reproducible workflows is therefore critical for the text analyst.Mapping Texts offers a practical introduction to computational text analysis with step-by-step guides on how to conduct actual text analysis workflows in the R statistical computing environment.

  abstract: >-
    Just as a traveler crossing a continent won’t sense the curvature of the
    earth, one lifetime of reading can’t grasp the largest patterns organizing
    literary history. This is the guiding premise behind Distant Horizons, which
    uses the scope of data newly available to us through digital libraries to
    tackle previously elusive questions about literature. Ted Underwood shows
    how digital archives and statistical tools, rather than reducing words to
    numbers (as is often feared), can deepen our understanding of issues that
    have always been central to humanistic inquiry. Without denying the
    usefulness of time-honored approaches like close reading, narratology, or
    genre studies, Underwood argues that we also need to read the larger arcs of
    literary change that have remained hidden from us by their sheer scale.
    Using both close and distant reading to trace the differentiation of genres,
    transformation of gender roles, and surprising persistence of aesthetic
    judgment, Underwood shows how digital methods can bring into focus the
    larger landscape of literary history and add to the beauty and complexity we
    value in literature.
