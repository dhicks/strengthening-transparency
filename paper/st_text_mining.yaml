  abstract: >-
    This paper evaluates the ability of various research designs in measuring
    small effects, that of air pollution on health in the short-term. Analyzing
    the epidemiology and economics literature, we ﬁrst show that a portion of
    these estimates are likely inaccurate. In the presence of publication bias,
    relatively small eﬀects are not only diﬃcult to detect, but resulting
    estimates also exaggerate true eﬀect sizes. We identify the design
    parameters causing this issue using real data simulations replicating most
    prevailing methods. Finally, we propose a principled workﬂow to evaluate and
    avoid the risk of exaggeration when conducting an observational study.

  abstract: >-
    The idea that science is or should be value-free, and that values are or
    should be formed independently of science, has been under fire by
    philosophers of science for decades. Science and Moral Imagination directly
    challenges the idea that science and values cannot and should not influence
    each other. Matthew J. Brown argues that science and values mutually
    influence and implicate one another, that the influence of values on science
    is pervasive and must be responsibly managed, and that science can and
    should have an influence on our values. This interplay, he explains, must be
    guided by accounts of scientific inquiry and value judgment that are
    sensitive to the complexities of their interactions. Brown presents
    scientific inquiry and value judgment as types of problem-solving practices
    and provides a new framework for thinking about how we might ethically
    evaluate episodes and decisions in science, while offering guidance for
    scientific practitioners and institutions about how they can incorporate
    value judgments into their work. His framework, dubbed "the ideal of moral
    imagination," emphasizes the role of imagination in value judgment and the
    positive role that value judgment plays in science.

    Millions of scientific articles are published each year, making it difficult
    to stay abreast of advances within even the smallest subdisciplines.
    Traditional approaches to the study of science, such as the history and
    philosophy of science, involve closely reading a relatively small set of
    journal articles. And yet many questions benefit from casting a wider net:
    Is most scientific change gradual or revolutionary? What are the key sources
    of scientific novelty? Over the past several decades, a massive effort to
    digitize the academic literature and equip computers with algorithms that
    can distantly read and analyze a digital database has taken us one step
    closer to answering these questions. The Dynamics of Science brings together
    a diverse array of contributors to examine the largely unexplored
    computational frontiers of history and philosophy of science. Together, they
    reveal how tools and data from automated textual analysis, or machine
    “reading,” combined with methods and models from game theory and cultural
    evolutionary theory, can begin to answer fundamental questions about the
    nature and history of science.

    Several cross-sectional investigations have found associations between
    mortality rates and particulate air pollution in U.S. metropolitan areas1–3.
    A recent study reported associations between infant mortality and
    particulate air pollution in the Czech Republic4. These studies have often
    been criticized because they did not control directly for cigarette smoking
    or other covariates. Recent daily time-series studies, which are likely to
    be free of confounding by individual characteristics, have reported
    associations between daily mortality rates and changes in air pollution,
    specifically particulate pollution, in London5 and in several cities in the
    United States6–12. Particulate air pollution is . . .

    Scholars in the history, philosophy, and social studies of science often
    explain public scientific controversies by appealing to views of the general
    public on appropriate roles for values in science. However, evidence that
    members of the public actually hold these views is limited. This paper
    presents the Values in Science Scale (VISS), a quantitative survey
    instrument designed to measure these views. Qualitative methods were used to
    ensure construct validity among US adults (Study 2). In one notable initial
    finding using VISS, the value-free ideal (VFI) — a traditional conception of
    objectivity — is not correlated with generalized trust in science.

  abstract: >-
    Concerns about a crisis of mass irreplicability across scientific fields
    (“the replication crisis”) have stimulated a movement for open science,
    encouraging or even requiring researchers to publish their raw data and
    analysis code. Recently, a rule at the US Environmental Protection Agency
    (US EPA) would have imposed a strong open data requirement. The rule
    prompted significant public discussion about whether open science practices
    are appropriate for fields of environmental public health. The aims of this
    paper are to assess (1) whether the replication crisis extends to fields of
    environmental public health; and (2) in general whether open science
    requirements can address the replication crisis. There is little empirical
    evidence for or against mass irreplicability in environmental public health
    specifically. Without such evidence, strong claims about whether the
    replication crisis extends to environmental public health — or not — seem
    premature. By distinguishing three concepts — reproducibility,
    replicability, and robustness — it is clear that open data initiatives can
    promote reproducibility and robustness but do little to promote
    replicability. I conclude by reviewing some of the other benefits of open
    science, and offer some suggestions for funding streams to mitigate the
    costs of adoption of open science practices in environmental public health.

    Anthropologists and human geneticists have long rejected race science,
    research that can be utilized to purportedly justify racial inequality and
    colonialism.  But race science has persisted, at the very least on the
    margins of the mainstream scientific community.  In this study,
    scientometric and text mining methods were used to trace the appearance of
    race science discourse in both mainstream behavioral science journals and
    the parascholarly journal *Mankind Quarterly* from 1960 to 2010.  Our
    analysis found two distinguishable lines of race science discourse.  One is
    strongly associated with *Mankind Quarterly*, while the other — emphasizing
    race and intelligence — is more prevalent with mainstream psychology
    journals, especially *Intelligence* and *Personality and Individual
    Differences*.  We compare psychology's response to race science to those of
    other fields, and discuss the social responsibility of scientists with
    respect to race science.

  abstract: >-
    While philosophers of science generally agree that social, political, and
    ethical values can play legitimate roles in science, there is active debate
    over whether scientists should disclosure such values in their public
    communications. This debate depends, in part, on empirical claims about
    whether values disclosures might undermine public trust in science. In a
    previous study, Elliott et al. used an online experiment to test this
    empirical claim. The current paper reports a replication attempt of their
    experiment. Comparing results of the original study and our replication, we
    do not find evidence for a transparency penalty or “shared values” effect,
    but do find evidence that the content of scientific conclusions (whether or
    not a chemical is found to cause harm) might effect perceived
    trustworthiness and that scientists who value public health and disclose
    this value might be perceived as more trustworthy.

  abstract: >-
    <p>Since at least the mid-2000s, political commentators, environmental
    advocates, and scientists have raised concerns about an “anti-science”
    approach to environmental policymaking in conservative governments in the US
    and Canada. This paper explores and resolves a paradox surrounding at least
    some uses of the “anti-science” epithet. I examine two cases of such
    “anti-science” environmental policy, both of which involve appeals to
    epistemic values that are widely endorsed by both scientists and
    philosophers of science. It seems paradoxical to call an appeal to epistemic
    values “anti-science.” I develop an analysis that, I argue, can resolve this
    paradox. This analysis is a version of the “aims approach” to science and
    values, drawing on ideas from axiology and virtue ethics. I characterize the
    paradox in terms of conflicts or tensions between epistemic and pragmatic
    aims, and argue that there is a key asymmetry between them: epistemic aims
    are valuable, in part, because they are useful for pursuing pragmatic aims.
    Thus, when epistemic and pragmatic aims conflict, epistemic aims need to be
    reconceptualized in order to reconcile them to pragmatic aims. When this is
    done, in the “anti-science” cases, the epistemic values are scientific vices
    rather than virtues. Thus the “anti-science” epithet is apt.</p>

    Topic model is a well proven tool to investigate the semantic content of
    textual corpora. Yet corpora sometimes include texts in several languages,
    making it impossible to apply language-specific computational approaches
    over their entire content. This is the problem we encountered when setting
    to analyze a philosophy of science corpus spanning over eight decades and
    including original articles in Dutch, German and French, on top of a large
    majority of articles in English. To circumvent this multilingual problem, we
    use machine-translation tools to bulk translate non-English documents into
    English. Though largely imperfect, especially syntactically, these
    translations nevertheless provide correctly translated terms and preserve
    the semantic proximity of documents with respect to one another. To assess
    the quality of this translation step, we develop a “semantic topology
    preservation test” that relies on estimating the extent to which
    document-to-document distances have been preserved during translation. We
    then conduct an LDA topic-model analysis over the entire corpus of
    translated and English original texts, and compare it to a topic-model done
    over the English original texts only. We thereby identify the specific
    contribution of the translated texts. These studies reveal a more complete

    As a discipline of its own, the philosophy of science can be traced back to
    the founding of its academic journals, some of which go back to the first
    half of the twentieth century. While the discipline has been the object of
    many historical studies, notably focusing on specific schools (e.g., logical
    empiricism) or major figures of the field (e.g., Carnap, Kuhn), little work
    has focused on the journals themselves. Here, we investigate contemporary
    philosophy of science by means of computational text-mining approaches: we
    apply topic-modeling algorithms to eight major philosophy of science
    journals, from the 1930s up until 2017. Based on the full-text content of
    some 15,897 articles, we identified 25 research themes and 8 thematic
    clusters that show how the research agenda of the philosophy of science has
    changed in its content over the course of the last eight decades, up to the
    philosophy of science we now know. We also show how each one of the journals
    contributed in its own way to this thematic evolution.

  abstract: >-
    Though only established as a discipline since the 1970s, philosophy of
    biology has already triggered investigations about its own history (e.g.,
    Grene and Depew in The philosophy of biology: an episodic history, Cambridge
    University Press, Cambridge, 2004. https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9780511819018;
    Hull, in: Ruse (ed) The Oxford handbook of philosophy of biology, Oxford
    University Press, New York, pp 11–33, 2008). When it comes to assessing the
    road since travelled—the research questions that have been pursued—manuals
    and ontologies also offer specific viewpoints, highlighting dedicated
    domains of inquiry and select work. In this article, we propose to approach
    the history of the philosophy of biology with a complementary data-driven
    perspective that makes use of statistical algorithms applied to the complete
    full-text corpus of one major journal of the field—Biology and
    Philosophy—from its launch in 1986 up until 2017. By running text-mining and
    topic-modeling algorithms, we identified 67 key research topics that span
    across these 32 years. We also investigated the evolution of these topics
    over time and their fluctuating significance in the journal articles. Our
    results concur with known episodes or traits of the discipline—for instance,
    the significance of evolution-related topics or the decrease of articles
    with a marked historical dimension—but also highlight a diversity of topics
    that is much richer than what is usually acknowledged.

  abstract: >-
    Search in an environment with an uncertain distribution of resources
    involves a trade-off between exploitation of past discoveries and further
    exploration. This extends to information foraging, where a knowledge-seeker
    shifts between reading in depth and studying new domains. To study this
    decision-making process, we examine the reading choices made by one of the
    most celebrated scientists of the modern era: Charles Darwin. From the
    full-text of books listed in his chronologically-organized reading journals,
    we generate topic models to quantify his local (text-to-text) and global
    (text-to-past) reading decisions using Kullback-Liebler Divergence, a
    cognitively-validated, information-theoretic measure of relative surprise.
    Rather than a pattern of surprise-minimization, corresponding to a pure
    exploitation strategy, Darwin’s behavior shifts from early exploitation to
    later exploration, seeking unusually high levels of cognitive surprise
    relative to previous eras. These shifts, detected by an unsupervised
    Bayesian model, correlate with major intellectual epochs of his career as
    identified both by qualitative scholarship and Darwin’s own self-commentary.
    Our methods allow us to compare his consumption of texts with their
    publication order. We find Darwin’s consumption more exploratory than the
    culture’s production, suggesting that underneath gradual societal changes
    are the explorations of individual synthesis and discovery. Our quantitative
    methods advance the study of cognitive search through a framework for
    testing interactions between individual and collective behavior and between
    short- and long-term consumption choices. This novel application of topic
    modeling to characterize individual reading complements widespread studies
    of collective scientific behavior.

  abstract: >-
    This article proposes a three-step methodological framework called
    computational grounded theory, which combines expert human knowledge and
    hermeneutic skills with the processing power and pattern recognition of
    computers, producing a more methodologically rigorous but interpretive
    approach to content analysis. The first, pattern detection step, involves
    inductive computational exploration of text, using techniques such as
    unsupervised machine learning and word scores to help researchers to see
    novel patterns in their data. The second, pattern refinement step, returns
    to an interpretive engagement with the data through qualitative deep reading
    or further exploration of the data. The third, pattern confirmation step,
    assesses the inductively identified patterns using further computational and
    natural language processing techniques. The result is an efficient,
    rigorous, and fully reproducible computational grounded theory. This
    framework can be applied to any qualitative text as data, including
    transcribed speeches, interviews, open-ended survey data, or ethnographic
    field notes, and can address many potential research questions.

    OBJECTIVE. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of
    prenatal exposure to chlorpyrifos on 3-year neurodevelopment and behavior in
    a sample of inner-city minority children.

    METHODS. As part of an ongoing prospective cohort study in an inner-city
    minority population, neurotoxicant effects of prenatal exposure to
    chlorpyrifos were evaluated in 254 children through the first 3 years of
    life. This report examined cognitive and motor development at 12, 24, and 36
    months (measured with the Bayley Scales of Infant Development II) and child
    behavior at 36 months (measured with the Child Behavior Checklist) as a
    function of chlorpyrifos levels in umbilical cord plasma.

    RESULTS. Highly exposed children (chlorpyrifos levels of >6.17 pg/g plasma)
    scored, on average, 6.5 points lower on the Bayley Psychomotor Development
    Index and 3.3 points lower on the Bayley Mental Development Index at 3 years
    of age compared with those with lower levels of exposure. Children exposed
    to higher, compared with lower, chlorpyrifos levels were also significantly
    more likely to experience Psychomotor Development Index and Mental
    Development Index delays, attention problems,
    attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder problems, and pervasive
    developmental disorder problems at 3 years of age.

    CONCLUSIONS. The adjusted mean 36-month Psychomotor Development Index and
    Mental Development Index scores of the highly and lower exposed groups
    differed by only 7.1 and 3.0 points, respectively, but the proportion of
    delayed children in the high-exposure group, compared with the low-exposure
    group, was 5 times greater for the Psychomotor Development Index and 2.4
    times greater for the Mental Development Index, increasing the number of
    children possibly needing early intervention services.

    Learn how to conduct a robust text analysis project from start to
    finish--and then do it again. Mining is the dominant metaphor in
    computational text analysis. When mining texts, the implied assumption is
    that analysts can find kernels of truth--they just have to sift through the
    rubbish first. In this book, Dustin Stoltz and Marshall Taylor encourage
    text analysts to work with a different metaphor in mind: mapping. When
    mapping texts, the goal is not necessarily to find meaningful needles in the
    haystack, but instead to create reductions of the text to document patterns.
    Just like with cartographic maps, though, the type and nature of the textual
    map is dependent on a range of decisions on the part of the researcher.
    Creating reproducible workflows is therefore critical for the text
    analyst.Mapping Texts offers a practical introduction to computational text
    analysis with step-by-step guides on how to conduct actual text analysis
    workflows in the R statistical computing environment. The focus is on social
    science questions and applications, with data ranging from fake news and
    presidential campaigns to Star Trek and pop stars. The book walks the reader
    through all facets of a text analysis workflow--from understanding the
    theories of language embedded in text analysis, all the way to more advanced
    and cutting-edge techniques.The book will prove useful not only to social
    scientists, but anyone interested in conducting text analysis projects.

    Just as a traveler crossing a continent won’t sense the curvature of the
    earth, one lifetime of reading can’t grasp the largest patterns organizing
    literary history. This is the guiding premise behind Distant Horizons, which
    uses the scope of data newly available to us through digital libraries to
    tackle previously elusive questions about literature. Ted Underwood shows
    how digital archives and statistical tools, rather than reducing words to
    numbers (as is often feared), can deepen our understanding of issues that
    have always been central to humanistic inquiry. Without denying the
    usefulness of time-honored approaches like close reading, narratology, or
    genre studies, Underwood argues that we also need to read the larger arcs of
    literary change that have remained hidden from us by their sheer scale.
    Using both close and distant reading to trace the differentiation of genres,
    transformation of gender roles, and surprising persistence of aesthetic
    judgment, Underwood shows how digital methods can bring into focus the
    larger landscape of literary history and add to the beauty and complexity we
    value in literature.
