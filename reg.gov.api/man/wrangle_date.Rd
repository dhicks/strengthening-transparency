\description{
This function is used by `get_blocks` to page through the blocks of 5000 comments:  get the date-time for the last comment of the previous block, add 1 second, and use that as the threshold for the next block.  However, the API reports date-times in the format `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ssZ`, using UTC, while the query language only accepts the format `YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm:ss` using Eastern time(America/New York).
